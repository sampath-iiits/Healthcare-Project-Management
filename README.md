#  Health Analytics Dashboard

##  Project Overview
The **Health Analytics Dashboard** project focuses on analyzing patient data to uncover insights about health trends, demographic distributions, and behavioral patterns.  
This project uses **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

**SQL** was used for data manipulation and feature engineering, **Excel** for initial data exploration, and **Power BI** for building an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to easily interpret insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering using **SQL**  
- Explore and validate data in **Excel**  
- Visualize key insights using **Power BI**  
- Understand patient distribution by gender, ethnicity, compulsion type, and obsession type  
- Analyze the relationship between obsession count and average obsession score
